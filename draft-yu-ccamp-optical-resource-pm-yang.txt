Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG          October 2023


1.  Introduction

   Performance monitoring is a basic function of optical networks
   management.  With it, operators can proactively detect the running
   state of devices, identify major risks in advanced and avoid users'
   complaints.

   As before, TMF has defined interfaces for performance management
   through traditional protocols, such as CORBA and MTOSI.  With the
   development of SDN technologies and the using of RESTCONF interfaces,
   it becomes a widespread requirement to use RESTCONF protocol to
   support performance monitoring.

   Using RESTCONF does not mean changing existing performance monitoring
   requirements or scenarios.  On the contrary, since O&M is very
   important, many operators' O&M departments tend to be conservative.
   Mostly, they are fear of introducing issues into their network due to
   the protocol changes and O&M habits changes.  Therefore, our document
   prefers to use the new protocol to support legacy functionality.

   Traditional performance management involves control of performance
   monitoring, setting collectors on monitored objects, and obtaining
   performance data in different periods.  The data can be current data
   on devices or processed by PNC, and historical performance data.  TCA
   can be also configured by performance monitoring tasks.

   ITU-T also has a lot of related recommendations for performance
   monitoring.  Such as session 10 of [ITU-T_G.7710] has provided very
   detail description of performance management application and
   functions.  [ITU-T_G.7710] does not provide a UML model or YANG
   module to guide the implementation of PNC while this document does.

   Section 10.2 of [ITU-T_G.874] provides a list of OM indicators which
   are on the NE level, which could help to reduce duplicated definition
   of performance indicators.

   Currently, there are some existing documents related to performance
   monitoring in IETF, but there is no overlap with our current work.
   For example:

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG          October 2023


   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics] provides a YANG data
   model that describes performance monitoring and scaling intent
   mechanisms for TE-Tunnels and Virtual Networks(VNs).  VN is
   determinate to be used in CMI (CNC-MDSC Interface) level and TE
   tunnel is more service or connection related.  Our data model is
   proposed to be used in MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface) level and this
   performance monitoring is performed on network resources, such as
   network element, board, fiber, port or TTP (Tunnel Termination
   Point), which are not included in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics].

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm] defines a YANG data model for
   performance monitoring of both network topology layer and overlay VPN
   service topology layer.  VPN service is more IP-specific and not
   adopted in Optical domain.  And the data model in this document is
   augmenting network model.  If the client wants to retrieve
   performance data of a link by RESTCONF, the URL would be probably
   same with the URL of topology retrieval.  This may need some special
   mechanisms to make the client and server differentiate the using
   scenarios.  This is not quite compliance with current O&M habits of
   Optical technology.

   [I-D.zheng-ccamp-client-pm-yang] provides a performance monitoring
   YANG data model on client signal level.  It is also not operated on
   resource level which is not compliance with the existing O&M habits.
   This performance monitoring solution is more user-oriented and can be
   used for more automatic O&M scenarios in the future.  However, there
   is not a complete closed-loop O&M solution at the service layer and
   it has not been accepted by all operators' O&M departments, resource-
   based performance monitoring is still required.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  YANG Data Model for Optical Performance Monitoring

   According to the business requirements stated in [TMF-518], resource
   performance management requirements include: * The Interface shall
   support the control of performance monitoring in the network.  This
   includes PM control, e.g., the enabling and disabling of PM
   collection and Threshold Crossing Alerts (TCA) control, e.g., the
   enabling and disabling of TCA generation. * The Interface shall
   support the retrieval of current and historical performance
   measurements for network resources. * The Interface shall support the
   distribution of TCAs to subscribed OSs.

   For these requirements of PM, there are three group of interfaces are
   defined in TMF, including PerformanceManagementControl,
   PerformanceManagementRetrieval and ThresholdCrossingAlertControl.

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG          October 2023


2.1.  Generic Resource

   The definition of most performance monitoring interfaces in TMF is
   quite generic.  And it is also similar that the functionalities of
   both alarm and performance monitoring can be defined with a generic
   structure, regardless of what kind of object is operated on.
   Therefore, our data model prefer to follow this approach.  And when
   defining our data model, we get refer to [RFC8632], in which a
   generic alarm data model is provided.  In [RFC8632], a union type of
   resource attributes is defined as the source of alarm.  So we also
   reference this structure in our data model.

   Additionally, we extend a resource-type attribute to indicate what
   exact kind of resource is.  Firstly, this attribute can help to
   improve interaction efficiency between PNC and MDSC.  The MDSC may
   quickly identify the resource type from this attribute, without
   parsing the resource identifier or searching the resource id in the
   whole resource.  On the other hand, it will be unified with the
   existing IETF topology and inventory objects and form a complete
   interface system.

   module: ietf-optical-resource-pm
      +--rw performance-monitoring
         +--rw resources
            +--rw resource-list* [resource]
               +--rw resource             union
               +--ro resource-type?       identityref

2.2.  PerformanceManagementControl

   There are three interfaces defined in TMF for this group, including:
   * clearPerformanceMonitoringData: This interface shall allow MDSC to
   clear or reset the performance register on TPs or NEs.  This clearing
   operation means to reset the data value to the current value.  The
   monitoring job is still running on. *
   disablePerformanceMonitoringData: This interface shall allow MDSC
   disable PM data collection on a list of TPs or NEs. *
   enablePerformanceMonitoringData: This interface shall allow MDSC
   enable PM data collection on a list of TPs or NEs.

2.2.1.  clearPerformanceMonitoringData

   Because the performance data can be changed frequently, so the
   current and history performance data are not suitable to define in a
   data model.  Clearing performance monitoring data is more suitable to
   define an RPC to perform this operation.  Especially according to the
   MTOSI interface, this clearing operation can be operated on multiple
   objects in one request.  Currently there is not such an approach to

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG          October 2023


   support this kind of flexible method if using data API.  Therefore we
   define a RPC operation to support this function.

   rpcs:
      +---x clear-performance-monitoring-data
         +--ro input
         |  +--ro resources*   leafref
         +--ro output
            +--ro failed-resources*   leafref

   If there are any resources failed to clear performance monitoring
   data, their identifier should be returned by the failed-resources
   leaf list.  An empty list indicates that this operation was performed
   successfully.

2.2.2.  enablePerformanceMonitoringData &
        disablePerformanceMonitoringData

   For interfaces of enable/disable performance monitoring data, we
   introduce a monitor task to do this control.  In the monitoring task,
   MDSC should be able to configure what period and what kind of
   performance data it want to collect.  The disabling, enabling
   operation can be satisfy by changing the admin status which includes
   disabled, enabled.  The change's result will affect the task status
   accordingly.

         |  +--rw monitor-task* [task-id]

         |              +--rw indicator-value-unit?   string

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG          October 2023


2.3.  PerformanceManagementRetrieval

   There are six interfaces are defined in TMF for this group,
   including: * getAllCurrentPerformanceMonitoringData: This interface
   should allow MDSC to retrieve performance data on a series of
   termination point. * getHistoryPerformanceMonitoringData: This
   interface should allow MDSC to retrieve some historic performance
   data on a series of termination point in a time period through FTP. *
   getAllPerformanceMonitoringPoints: This interface should allow MDSC
   to retrieve all the performance monitoring points in a specified
   termination point or NE. * getHoldingTime: This interface should
   allow MDSC to retrieve how many hours PM data records are held in
   PNC. * getMePerformanceMonitoringCapabilities: This interface should
   allow MDSC to retrieve what parameters are supported by a specified
   NE or termination point. * getProfileAssociatedTerminationPoints: The
   Interface shall allow MDSC to retrieve the names of all the TPs known
   to the PNC that are associated with a specified Threshold Crossing
   Alert (TCA) Parameter Profile.

2.3.1.  getAllCurrentPerformanceMonitoringData &
        getHistoryPerformanceMonitoringData

   For the retrieval of current/historic performance data, we consider
   these data are not suitable to define in a data model.  Because
   performance data can be changed frequently and if we follow that
   approach, according to the requirement of on-change notification in
   YANG-push [RFC8641], once the performance data changes, the PNC
   should trigger a notification to the MDSC, there would be great
   amount of notifications reported in the big network.  These great
   amount of notifications will bring great pressure to both PNC and
   MDSC.  People don't use notification to get performance data in real
   network.

   These two retrieval interfaces are usually invoked on-demand.  It is
   also hard to support retrieving performance data of multiple
   resources by data model in one request.  And for historic performance
   data retrieval, there could be a requirement to specify the start
   time and end time.  It is not quite flexible to support this
   requirement by data model neither.

   So we suggest to define two RPCs to accomplish these two interfaces'
   function.

   These three interfaces allow MDSC to retrieve performance monitoring
   points, holding time, and performance monitoring capabilities
   (indicators) as per a specific resource.  We consider that these
   information are all performance monitoring capabilities in a broad
   sense.  These information should be defined under the resource node.

   The sub-resources is list of the performance monitoring points'
   identifier.  And the pm-parameter-list is the indicators that can be
   supported by this specific resource.

2.3.3.  getProfileAssociatedTerminationPoints

   For the TCA related definition, it can be found in the next session.
   A TCA profile can be associated with a lot of resources, so we don't
   defined a resource list under the profile instance to avoid reporting
   some unnecessary notifications while the resource instances in this
   list have been changed.  We define a RPC operation to support this
   flexible retrieval request.

   rpcs:
      +---x get-profile-associated-termination-points
         +--ro input
         |  +--ro profile-id?   leafref
         +--ro output
            +--ro resource-list*   leafref

2.4.  ThresholdCrossingAlertControl

   There are nine interfaces are defined in TMF for this group,
   including: * createTcaParameterProfile: This interface should allow
   MDSC to create a new TCA parameter profile.  This profile can be
   applied to the resources. * deleteTcaParameterProfile: This interface
   should allow MDSC to delete an existing TCA parameter profile which
   should not have been used by any resources. *
   enableThresholdCrossingAlert: This interface should allow MDSC to
   turn on TCA reporting on a list of TPs and NEs if the reporting was
   turned off before. * disableThresholdCrossingAlert: This interface
   should allow MDSC to turn off TCA reporting on a list of TPs and NEs.
   * getAllTcaParameterProfiles: This interfaces should allow MDSC to
   retrieve all TCA parameter profile that are being managed by a
   specified NE. * getTcaParameterProfile: This interface should allow
   MDSC to retrieve all the parameters of a specified TCA parameter
   profile. * getTcaTpParameter: This interface should allow MDSC to

   retrieve the PM threshold values on a TP. * setTcaParameterProfile:
   This interface should allow MDSC to configure all threshold values of
   a TCA parameter profile. * setTcaTpParameter: This interface should
   allow MDSC to modify the values of TCA Parameters on a TP

   To be summarized, there are four main requirements for Threshold
   Crossing Alert Control: * Creation/retrieval/deletion/updating of TCA
   profile; * Enabling/disabling TCA reporting on the resource; *
   Configuring TCA on the resource by associating an existing profile; *
   Configuring TCA on the resource by detailed parameters.

   And for the TCA parameters, no matter it is configured directly on
   the resource or by a preset profile, there should not be any
   differences.  The TCA parameter (indicator) should include: *
   indicator-name: Name of indicator.  This indicator should also
   include some data processing information, such if it is a maximum, or
   minimum, or average data .etc. * threshold-type: This threshold type
   is used to indicate when the alert will be triggered.  By exceeding
   the upper bound value, or by below the lower bound value. * period:
   This period is used to indicate the frequency of the data collection.
   * severity: This severity is used to indicate what level of alert
   would be triggered if cross the threshold. * indicator-value: The
   value of threshold. * indicator-value-unit: The unit of threshold
   value.

   The tree structure for TCA profile:

   The function of enabling/disabling TCA on the resource can be
   controlled by an admin-status attributes in "tca" node:

      +--rw performance-monitoring
         +--rw monitor-tasks
         |  +--rw monitor-task* [task-id]

         |        +--rw admin-status?       enumeration
         |        +--......................

   If MDSC wants to configure TCA by an existing profile, it can use
   this applied-profiles structure:

   module: ietf-optical-resource-pm
      +--rw performance-monitoring
         +--rw monitor-tasks
         |  +--rw monitor-task* [task-id]

         |     +--rw tca* [resource-id]
         |        +--rw resource-id         leafref
         |        +--ro resource-type?      identityref

         |        |     +--rw profile-id    leafref
         |        +--......................

   MDSC can also configure TCA value directly by the "tca-cfg"
   structure:

3.  Performance Indicator Introduction

   In the session10.2 of [ITU-T_G.874], a performance management
   information table lists all the PM current data and history data
   collected on the EMF(Equipment Management Function).  Since it is
   quite mature, this document would not like to do a duplicated
   research and would like to reference this recommendation.  It is
   suggested to use the existing PM indicator listed in this table only
   if it is missing.

   It is impossible to list all the PM indicator exhaustively, even if
   ITU-T has done a lot of work.  Some new performance indicators would
   be raised once there are some new requirements and technologies.  So
   in this document we would like to provide String type rather than an
   explicit type for performance indicator, to have a better
   compatibility for future extension.  Then if there are some new
   indicators, there is no need to revise this document or create a
   branch of documents to standardize the PM indicators.

   Although this approach seems too flexible, the integration will not
   be affected if the MDSC and PNC make a good agreement in advanced.

7.  Manageability Considerations

   <Add any manageability considerations>

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

Internet-Draft         Performance Monitoring YANG          October 2023


   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795]are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC6020].
